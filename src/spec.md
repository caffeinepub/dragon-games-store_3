# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace platform emojis with actual logo images and add navigation arrows to horizontally scrollable game rows.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace platform emoji icons (🖥️, 🎮, 🎮) with actual logo images (Steam, Xbox, PlayStation)
- Add white navigation arrows on left and right sides of each game row for horizontal scrolling
- Hide/disable arrows when at start or end of row
- Ensure logos are properly sized and styled to match existing badge design

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see professional platform logos instead of emojis on game cards, and clear white arrow buttons to navigate through games in each row.
