# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve game card display by enlarging game images and changing video playback to click-triggered instead of automatic.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the size of game images in the GameCard component
- Change video trailer behavior to only play when user clicks on the game image

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see larger, more prominent game images and can control when video trailers start playing by clicking on the images.
